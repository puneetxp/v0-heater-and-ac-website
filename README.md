## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/puneet-sharmas-projects-2ade9773/v0-heater-and-ac-website](https://vercel.com/puneet-sharmas-projects-2ade9773/v0-heater-and-ac-website)**

### Vercel Analytics setup

1. Install `@vercel/analytics` (already listed in `package.json`). Update with `pnpm add @vercel/analytics` (or npm/yarn) if needed.
2. Ensure `<Analytics />` from `@vercel/analytics/next` is rendered in `app/layout.tsx` (already wired up).
3. Deploy to Vercel and visit the deployed site with blockers disabled. First visits can take ~30 seconds to appear in the Analytics dashboard.
4. If the dashboard still shows onboarding, verify Analytics is enabled for this project in the Vercel dashboard.
